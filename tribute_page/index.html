        <h3>
          In the early 1940s, Brooklyn-born toy inventor George Lerner came up
          with the idea of inserting small, pronged body and face parts into
          fruits and vegetables to create a "funny face man". Some speculate he
          got the idea from his wife's nephew Aaron Bradley, who was seen
          placing sticks inside of potatoes in the family garden. Lerner would
          often take potatoes from his mother's garden and, using various other
          fruits and vegetables as facial features, he would make dolls with
          which his younger sisters could play. The grape-eyed, carrot-nosed,
          potato-headed dolls became the principal idea behind the plastic toy
          which would later be manufactured.
