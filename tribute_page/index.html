      In the early 1940s, Brooklyn-born toy inventor George Lerner came up with
      the idea of inserting small, pronged body and face parts into fruits and
      vegetables to create a "funny face man". Some speculate he got the idea
      from his wife's nephew Aaron Bradley, who was seen placing sticks inside
      of potatoes in the family garden. Lerner would often take potatoes from
      his mother's garden and, using various other fruits and vegetables as
      facial features, he would make dolls with which his younger sisters could
      play. The grape-eyed, carrot-nosed, potato-headed dolls became the
      principal idea behind the plastic toy which would later be manufactured.
